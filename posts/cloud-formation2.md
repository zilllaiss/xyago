On 18 August 2026, I saw [an amazing cloud formation](/posts/cloud-formation/) in the morning.
After that, I took some time to study more about clouds and fairly sure that Stratocumulus was the type before.

I'm not an expert yet though! 
I'm still more or less gussing from the shape. But hey, is not that the most interesting part about cloud _formation_?

This thick cloudy morning is most likely Altocumulus perlucidus. 
It's not the most beautiful (and a little more depressing even), but the shape is still pretty interesting.

I only took two pictures this time, but still, enjoy!
