The goal is to allow people, especially Muslims, to discover information and beneficial knowledge from across the horizons,
while also preserving the knowledge with the collaborations of Muslims so it is not gone with the passage of time.
The main entry is Literature, which includes book, article, and any beneficial written form of Islamic knowledge.

The site is backend written in Go. 
The frontend uses Templ (Go library), HTMX, and Alpine as the main components.

It's been 2 months since then, and biidhnillāh, I'm working on populating the website with information.
There's currently only less than 20 literatures, and I'm planning to add more.

The site is still pretty much in early launch so the entries count overall is still few. 
The features are also basics, but more of them to come, in shāa Allah.
