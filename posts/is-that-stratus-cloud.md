One of the dream I had is seeing actual stratus cloud. 
Two months ago, I'd given a chance to see it with my own eyes, alhamdu lillāh.

Before you ask, yes, I kinda late posting this as I've been pretty busy.
Particulary, with a certain _database website_ that I just deployed.

Anyway, here's the pictures.
